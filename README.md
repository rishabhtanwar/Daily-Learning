Kotlin withContext and async-await: when to use which one.

The thumb rules for withContext vs Async-await:

- Use withContext when you do not need the parallel execution.

- Use async only when you need the parallel execution.

- Both withContext and async can be used to get the result which is not possible with the launch.

- Use withContext to return the result of a single task.

- Use async for results from multiple tasks that run in parallel.
